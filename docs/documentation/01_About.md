Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes (FABIO) is a TWAS fine-mapping method that relies on a probit model to directly relate multiple genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) to binary outcome in TWAS fine-mapping. Additionally, it jointly models all genes located on the same chromosome to account for the correlation among GReX arising from cis-SNP LD and expression correlation across genomic regions. Through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, it obtains the posterior probability of having a non-zero effect for each gene, which is also known as the posterior inclusion probability (PIP). PIP serves as an important measure of evidence for the geneâ€™s association with the outcome trait, and FABIO nominates signal genes based PIP.
