## multi-tissue Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes (mFABIO)
![mfabio](mFABIO_scheme.png)
mFABIO is a TWAS fine-mapping method that utilizes a probit model to directly analyze binary outcomes and jointly models gene-tissue pairs across multiple tissues within a given locus. This approach accounts for correlations in genetically regulated expression (GReX) among genes and tissues. Through a Bayesian variational inference algorithm, it obtains the posterior probability of having a non-zero effect for each gene-tissue pair, which is also known as the posterior inclusion probability (PIP). PIP serves as an important measure of evidence for the geneâ€™s association with the outcome trait, and mFABIO generates PIPs at both the gene-tissue pair level and the gene level to nominate signal gene-tissue pairs and genes.
