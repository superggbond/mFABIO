Title: multi-tissue Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Haihan Zhang
Maintainer: Haihan Zhang <hhzhang@umich.edu>
Description: This package performs multi-tissue TWAS fine-mapping on binary outcomes 
    by jointly modeling all gene-tissue pairs across multiple tissues, and 
    provides the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) as an important 
    measure of evidence for the geneâ€™s association with the outcome trait.
